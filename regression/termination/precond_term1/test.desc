CBMC 5.12 introduced significant changes to solvers and this test failure
seems to be one of its consequences. The formulae pushed into the solver
seem to be identical to the previous 2LS version, however the solver in
SSA analyzer then throws UNSAT on the first iteration when doing
backward analysis (the invariants up until that point are correct)
resulting in no improvements done to the template.

This problem will require further investigation once the CBMC rebase
is complete
